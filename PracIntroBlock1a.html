      <h3>Study Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        To begin we want to introduce you to a speeded categorization task that we will return to later.
      </p>
      <h4>GO/NO-GO Task</h4>
      <p>
        In this GO/NO-GO task, you will be shown a series of words in the center of the computer screen. Some of the words will belong to <b>TARGET CATEGORIES</b>. If you see a word that belongs to a target category, your task is to &ldquo;GO&rdquo; by pressing the SPACEBAR as quickly as possible.&nbsp;In contrast, if you see a word that does NOT belong to a target category, you should simply ignore it (&ldquo;NO-GO&rdquo;).
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>For example, if the target category is WHITE OBJECTS you should press the SPACE BAR as fast as you can every time you see a white-object word, and ignore all other words.</li>
          <li>Each word will only remain on the screen for a fraction of a second.</li>
          <li>You need to make a response before the word disappears and if you fail to, this will be counted as an error and a <span style="color:#FF0000;\">red X</span> will appear.</li>
          <li>If you press the SPACE BAR when the word is NOT a target word (not a BIRD), this will also be an error and <span style="color:#0000FF;\">two blue exclamation marks !!</span> will appear.</li>
          <li>The task is very fast and you will make mistakes! That&rsquo;s okay, just pick up and go on to the next trial.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Press the SPACEBAR to continue.
      </p>
